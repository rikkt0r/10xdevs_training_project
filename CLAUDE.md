# AI Rules for Simple Issue Tracker

Description available in docs/PRD.md

## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for REACT

#### REACT_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for {{data_fetching_heavy_components}} when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

#### REDUX

- Use Redux Toolkit (RTK) instead of plain Redux to reduce boilerplate code
- Implement the slice pattern for organizing related state, reducers, and actions
- Use RTK Query for data fetching to eliminate manual loading state management
- Prefer createSelector for memoized selectors to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- Normalize complex state structures using a flat entities approach with IDs as references
- Implement middleware selectively and avoid overusing thunks for simple state updates
- Use the listener middleware for complex side effects instead of thunks where appropriate
- Leverage createEntityAdapter for standardized CRUD operations
- Implement Redux DevTools for debugging in development environments
- Use typed hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector) with TypeScript for type safety

## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for SUPPORT_LEVEL

#### SUPPORT_EXPERT

- Favor elegant, maintainable solutions over verbose code. Assume understanding of language idioms and design patterns.
- Highlight potential performance implications and optimization opportunities in suggested code.
- Frame solutions within broader architectural contexts and suggest design alternatives when appropriate.
- Focus comments on 'why' not 'what' - assume code readability through well-named functions and variables.
- Proactively address edge cases, race conditions, and security considerations without being prompted.
- When debugging, provide targeted diagnostic approaches rather than shotgun solutions.
- Suggest comprehensive testing strategies rather than just example tests, including considerations for mocking, test organization, and coverage.


### Guidelines for VERSION_CONTROL

#### GIT

- Use conventional commits to create meaningful commit messages
- Use feature branches with descriptive names following {{branch_naming_convention}}
- Write meaningful commit messages that explain why changes were made, not just what
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes to facilitate code review and bisection
- Use interactive rebase to clean up history before merging feature branches
- Leverage git hooks to enforce code quality checks before commits and pushes


### Guidelines for DOCUMENTATION

#### SWAGGER

- Define comprehensive schemas for all request and response objects
- Use semantic versioning in API paths to maintain backward compatibility
- Implement detailed descriptions for endpoints, parameters, and {{domain_specific_concepts}}
- Configure security schemes to document authentication and authorization requirements
- Use tags to group related endpoints by resource or functional area
- Implement examples for all endpoints to facilitate easier integration by consumers

## BACKEND

### Guidelines for PYTHON

#### PROJECT_STRUCTURE

- The virtualenv is located at `<project-root>/backend/venv`
- Always change directory to `<project-root>/backend` before running Python code, migrations, or any backend commands
- All configuration files (alembic.ini, etc.) are located in the `<project-root>/backend` directory
- Activate virtualenv using `source venv/bin/activate` from within the backend directory
- Development database is available from project docker-compose. If unable to connect to database, run `docker compose up -d db` from `<project-root>`
- **IMPORTANT**: Always run Alembic migrations and any database-related commands with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` because sandbox mode blocks network connections to localhost

#### FASTAPI

- Use Pydantic models for request and response validation with strict type checking and custom validators
- Implement dependency injection for services and database sessions to improve testability and resource management
- Use async endpoints for I/O-bound operations to improve throughput for {{high_load_endpoints}}
- Leverage FastAPI's background tasks for non-critical operations that don't need to block the response
- Implement proper exception handling with HTTPException and custom exception handlers for {{error_scenarios}}
- Use path operation decorators consistently with appropriate HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, etc.)

## DATABASE

### Guidelines for SQL

#### POSTGRES

- Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently
- Implement JSONB columns for semi-structured data instead of creating many tables for {{flexible_data}}
- Use materialized views for complex, frequently accessed read-only data

## DEVOPS

### Guidelines for CONTAINERIZATION

#### DOCKER

- Use multi-stage builds to create smaller production images
- Implement layer caching strategies to speed up builds for {{dependency_types}}
- Use non-root users in containers for better security


### Guidelines for CI_CD

#### GITHUB_ACTIONS

- Check if `package.json` exists in project root and summarize key scripts
- Check if `.nvmrc` exists in project root
- Check if `.env.example` exists in project root to identify key `env:` variables
- Always use terminal command: `git branch -a | cat` to verify whether we use `main` or `master` branch
- Always use `env:` variables and secrets attached to jobs instead of global workflows
- Always use `npm ci` for Node-based dependency setup
- Extract common steps into composite actions in separate files
- Once you're done, as a final step conduct the following: for each public action always use <tool>"Run Terminal"</tool> to see what is the most up-to-date version (use only major version) - extract tag_name from the response:
- ```bash curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest ```

## TESTING

### Guidelines for UNIT

#### PYTEST

- Use fixtures for test setup and dependency injection
- Implement parameterized tests for testing multiple inputs for {{function_types}}
- Use monkeypatch for mocking dependencies
